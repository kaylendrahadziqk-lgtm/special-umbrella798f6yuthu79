IndoKarya - Full project bundle (frontend + backend skeleton) - UPDATED (Auth + UI)

How to run (basic):
1. cd server
2. npm install
3. node server.js
4. Open http://localhost:3000/

Default admin credentials (change immediately):
- username: admin
- password: admin123

Notes:
- Uploaded files are stored in public/uploads
- db.json holds metadata for participants
- Auth uses express-session and bcrypt. Admin pages require login.
- This is a starter scaffold. Adjust security / auth before production.
